## Introduction

Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using dataâ€”without being explicitly programmed. 

The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information.

## Linear Regression with One Variable

Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.

## Linear Algebra Review

This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.

## Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines, or SVMs, is a machine learning algorithm for classification. 

We introduce the idea and intuitions behind SVMs and discuss how to use it in practice.
