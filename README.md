# WEEK 1

## 1.1 Introduction

Welcome to Machine Learning! In this module, we introduce the core idea of teaching a computer to learn concepts using dataâ€”without being explicitly programmed. 

The Course Wiki is under construction. Please visit the resources tab for the most complete and up-to-date information.

## 1.2 Linear Regression with One Variable

Linear regression predicts a real-valued output based on an input value. 

We discuss the application of linear regression to housing price prediction, present the notion of a cost function, and introduce the gradient descent method for learning.

### Model and Cost Function
- Model Representation
- Cost Function
- Cost Function - Intuition I
- Cost Function - Intuition II

### Parameter Learning

- Gradient Descent Intuition
- Gradient Descent For Linear Regression







## 1.3 Linear Algebra Review

This optional module provides a refresher on linear algebra concepts. 

Basic understanding of linear algebra is necessary for the rest of the course, especially as we begin to cover models with multiple variables.


- Matrices and Vectors
- Addition and Scalar Multiplication
- Matrix Vector Multiplication
- Matrix Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix Multiplication Properties
- Inverse and Transpose

# WEEK 2

## Linear Regression with Multiple Variables

What if your input has more than one value? In this module, we show how linear regression can be extended to accommodate multiple input features. 

We also discuss best practices for implementing linear regression.

## Octave/Matlab Tutorial

This course includes programming assignments designed to help you understand how to implement the learning algorithms in practice. 

To complete the programming assignments, you will need to use Octave or MATLAB. 

This module introduces Octave/Matlab and shows you how to submit an assignment.

## Support Vector Machines

Support vector machines, or SVMs, is a machine learning algorithm for classification. 

We introduce the idea and intuitions behind SVMs and discuss how to use it in practice.
